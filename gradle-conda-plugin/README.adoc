== Getting Started ==

This section is a quick start guide to show you how to use the `io.logbee.gradle.python` plugin to build and test a simple
python project. You can find more examples in the `examples` directory.

=== Layout ===
Given the following example project:

```
example
├── build.gradle
├── src
│   └── example.py
└── test
    └── test_example.py
```

[NOTE]
====
.Project Layout

The layout of the project can be changed according to your preferences, see <<project-layout>>.
====

=== Configuration ===

Create a `build.gradle` script as shown below:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
```
plugins {
  id "io.logbee.gradle.python" version "{version}" <1>
}

dependencies { <2>
    api 'anaconda:protobuf:3.8.0' <3>
    test 'conda-forge:pytest:5.1.2' <4>
}
```

The script does the following things:

. It applies the `io.logbee.gradle.python` plugin to the project. This will in turn also apply the `io.logbee.gradle.conda` plugin.
. It declares a couple of dependencies.
. It adds `protobuf` in version `3.8.0` to the `api`-configuration using conda's `anaconda` channel.
. It adds `pytest` in version `5.1.2` to the `test`-configuration using conda's `conda-forge` channel.

[NOTE]
====
.Conda Channels

Conda packages are downloaded from remote channels, which are URLs to directories containing conda packages. Read more about channels https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/channels.html[here].
====



=== Usage ===

Now you can invoke gradle in the root of the project. Most of the things are done during the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_lifecycle.html[evaluation of the project].
Therefore it doesn't matter which task you run. A simple `$ gradle` call will also work.

The conda plugin is gonging to do the following things:

. It downloads a suitable https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html[Miniconda] distribution into the gradle cache.
. It installs Miniconda into your gradle-home.
. It setups a conda environment in the project's `.gradle` directory.
. It installs the dependencies declared in the `build.gradle` into the project's conda environment.

==== Testing ====

To run the tests simply call: `$ gradle test`

[IMPORTANT]
====
.PyTestTask

The PyTestTask uses https://docs.pytest.org/[pytest] to run the tests. PyTest is not automatically installed. It
has to be added as dependency to the project. This may change in later versions.
====

[[project-layout]]
== Project Layout ==

By using https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.SourceSet.html[SourceSets], the project's directory structure (layout) can be adjusted to your needs/preferences.

The `io.logbee.gradle.python` plugin uses a `main` and a `test` source-set to manage the sources. The location of the sources
can be specified by passing a path to the directory.

=== Default Layout ===

.Layout
```
.
├── build.gradle
├── src
│   └── example.py
└── test
    └── test_example.py
```

.build.gradle
```
sourceSets {
    main {
        python {
            srcDir 'src'
        }
    }
    test {
        python {
            srcDir 'test'
        }
    }
}
```

=== Maven Layout ===

.Layout
```
.
├── build.gradle
└── src
    ├── main
    │   └── python
    │       └── example.py
    └── test
        └── python
            └── test_example.py
```

.build.gradle
```
sourceSets {
    main {
        python {
            srcDir 'src/main/python'
        }
    }
    test {
        python {
            srcDir 'src/test/python'
        }
    }
}
```
